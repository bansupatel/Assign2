3.3.2

1. Use the command git branch -d about-page to delete the topic branch. Confirm by running git branch that only the main branch is left.

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git branch -d about-page
Deleted branch about-page (was 502ef75).

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git branch
* main

2. InListing3.3,weusedgitcheckout-btocreateabranchandcheck
it out at the same time, but it’s also possible to break this into two steps.

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git branch test-branch

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git branch
* main
  test-branch

3. Check out test-branch and use touch to add a file with a name of your choice, then add and commit it to the repository.

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git checkout test-branch
Switched to branch 'test-branch'

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (test-branch)
$ touch practise

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (test-branch)
$ git add -A

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (test-branch)
$ git commit -am "Added my file..."

fatal: The current branch test-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

 * [new branch]      test-branch -> test-branch
branch 'test-branch' set up to track 'origin/test-branch'.

4. Check out the main branch and try deleting the test branch using git branch -d to confirm that it doesn’t work. The reason is that, in con­ trast to the about-page branch, the test branch hasn’t been merged into main, and by design -d doesn’t work in this case. Because we don’t actually want its changes, delete the test by using the related -D option, which deletes the branch in question even if its changes are unmerged.
