1. Commit the .gitignore file to your repository. Hint: Running git commit -am isn’t enough. Why not?
  - Done.
  - git commit -am will only tracked the file. git push needs to run to push the changes to the repository.
2. Push your commit up to GitHub and confirm using the web interface that the push succeeded.
  - Push Done.
  - Push succeeded.


Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git checkout -f
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (main)
$ git checkout -b test-branch
Switched to a new branch 'test-branch'

Patel@DESKTOP-17DSVEV MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Assign2 (test-branch)
$ git checkout --force

1. The git checkout -f trick works only with files that are staged for commit or are already part of the repository, but sometimes you want to get rid of new files as well. Using touch, create a file with a name of your choice, then git add it. Verify that running git checkout -f gets rid of it.
  - Yes git checkout -f get rids of the file I have created. 
2. Like many other Unix programs, git accepts both “short form” and “long form” options. Repeat the previous exercise with git checkout --force to confirm that the effects of -f and --force are identical. Extra credit: Double­check this conclusion by finding the “force” option in the output of git help checkout.
  - Yes git checkout -f and git checkout --force has the same function.
  - -f, --force
           When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD, and even if there are untracked files in the way. This is used to throw away local changes and any
           untracked files or directories that are in the way.
